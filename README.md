# Energy Monitor

A comprehensive web application for monitoring and analyzing energy consumption data, built with Flask.

## Project Description

Energy Monitor is a web application designed to help users track, visualize, and optimize their energy usage. The platform provides real-time monitoring, historical analysis, and intelligent recommendations to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainability.

The application offers a user-friendly dashboard for homeowners, building managers, and organizations to make informed decisions about their energy usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and implement energy-saving measures.

## Features

- **Real-time Energy Monitoring**: Track current energy consumption across different sources
- **Historical Data Analysis**: View and analyze past energy usage patterns
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Understand energy consumption through intuitive charts and graphs
- **Device-level Tracking**: Monitor energy usage for individual appliances and systems
- **Customizable Alerts**: Receive notifications for unusual energy consumption patterns
- **Energy-saving Recommendations**: Get personalized suggestions to reduce energy usage
- **User Authentication**: Secure multi-user access with role-based permissions
- **API Integration**: Connect with smart home devices and energy meters

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM (supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with optional framework integration)
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js / D3.js
- **API**: RESTful API architecture

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/energy-monitor.git
   cd energy-monitor
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration settings
   ```

5. Initialize the database
   ```bash
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade
   ```

6. Run the application
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

7. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

## Configuration

The application uses a configuration system with different environments:

- **Development**: Default configuration for local development
- **Testing**: Configuration for running tests
- **Production**: Optimized configuration for deployment

Configuration can be set via environment variables or the `.env` file.
